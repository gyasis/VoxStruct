# Understanding Coronary Artery Disease

At Online Med, we walk you through every topic in detail, so you're ready for the boards and the wards. In this video, we're going to be talking about coronary artery disease (CAD). 

## Spectrum of Coronary Artery Disease

Coronary artery disease is primarily associated with chest pain. I want to open with that, as it represents the spectrum of CAD. We will discuss how to identify someone with CAD and what actions to take.

There is a spectrum from:

1. **Asymptomatic Coronary Artery Disease**
2. **Stable Angina**
3. **Unstable Angina**
4. **Heart Attacks (STEMI and NSTEMI)**

### Categories of Pain

When discussing these conditions, consider the following categories:

- **What brings on the pain?**
- **What relieves the pain?**
- **What is going on with the biomarkers?** (We will discuss biomarkers later.)
- **Are there any ST segment changes?**

You can generally correlate these conditions with the percentage of occlusion in the coronary arteries.

## Asymptomatic Coronary Artery Disease

Asymptomatic coronary artery disease is characterized by the absence of symptoms. Patients may undergo procedures like angiograms, revealing CAD without any chest pain. This condition typically represents less than 50% occlusion. 

**Note:** Do not stent non-occlusive coronary artery disease.

## Stable Angina

Stable angina occurs next on the spectrum. Patients will experience pain with exertion, which is relieved by rest. There is no heart damage, so biomarkers remain normal, and there are no ST segment elevation changes. This condition generally indicates about 70% occlusion.

## Unstable Angina

Unstable angina is characterized by chest pain that occurs at rest and is not relieved by rest. There is no heart damage, so biomarkers remain unchanged, and there are no ST segment changes. This condition represents about 90% occlusion.

## Myocardial Infarction (STEMI and NSTEMI)

The distinction between STEMI (ST segment elevation myocardial infarction) and NSTEMI (non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction) is crucial. 

- **STEMI**: The heart is damaged, and biomarkers will be elevated. ST segment elevation is present, indicating a 100% occlusion.
- **NSTEMI**: Similar to STEMI but without ST segment elevation, indicating a 90% occlusion.

### Supply vs. Demand Ischemia

- **STEMI**: This represents supply ischemia. Regardless of the heart's workload, there is no supply, leading to potential heart damage. Intervention is necessary to reopen the blocked vessel.
  
- **Stable Angina**: This represents demand ischemia. It is not a total occlusion; therefore, reducing the heart's workload can reverse the damage. Symptoms only arise with exertion.

Unstable angina and NSTEMI approach STEMI with a larger occlusion and can occur at rest. All unstable angina and STEMI cases require hospital admission, whereas stable angina and asymptomatic CAD can be managed in an outpatient setting.

## Identifying Acute Coronary Syndrome

To spot someone who might have acute coronary syndrome, consider the following elements:

- **History of Presenting Illness**
- **Patient's Personal History** (risk factors)
- **Associated Symptoms**
- **Physical Exam**

### Diamond Classification

For the presenting illness, look for three key features known as the Diamond Classification:

1. Substernal or left-sided chest pain
2. Pain worsened by exertion and relieved by rest
3. Pain relieved by nitroglycerin

- **Typical Angina**: 3 out of 3 criteria
- **Atypical Angina**: 2 out of 3 criteria
- **Non-Anginal**: 0 or 1 criteria

### Risk Factors for Coronary Artery Disease

Risk factors associated with CAD include:

- **Modifiable Factors**:
  - Diabetes
  - Smoking
  - Hypertension
  - Dyslipidemia
  - Obesity

- **Non-Modifiable Factors**:
  - Family history of early CAD or death
  - Age (greater than 40 for men, greater than 55 for women)

## Symptoms and Physical Exam

When assessing chest pain, also inquire about:

- Dyspnea
- Presyncope
- Nausea and vomiting

The presence of these symptoms increases the pre-test probability of CAD.

### Physical Exam Characteristics

In a patient suspected of having cardiovascular ischemia, look for:

- Non-pleuritic pain (does not hurt with deep breaths)
- Non-positional pain (unchanged by body position)
- Non-tender pain (not reproducible on chest wall palpation)

## Workup for Chest Pain

When a patient presents with chest pain, the priority is to rule out the most severe disease first, specifically STEMI. 

1. **Perform a 12-lead EKG**:
   - If ST segment elevations are present, proceed to left heart catheterization (cath lab) urgently.
   - If no ST segment elevations are found, proceed to the next level of acuity, NSTEMI.

2. **Troponin Testing**:
   - Troponins are sensitive and specific for heart injury and will peak early.
   - For reinfarction cases, check CK-MB instead, as troponins will remain elevated.

If elevated troponins are found, proceed to cath, but this can be done urgently rather than immediately.

### Unstable Angina

Unstable angina is characterized by chest pain that occurs with less exertion or increased pain with the same exertion. This condition requires cath lab intervention, even if ST segment elevations and troponins are not elevated.

## Stress Testing

If STEMI and NSTEMI are ruled out, the next step is to determine if the chest pain is due to coronary ischemia, typically through a stress test.

### Stress Test Modalities

1. **Exercise Stress Test**: Preferred if the patient can exercise.
2. **Pharmacologic Stress Test**: Use if the patient cannot exercise (e.g., due to arthritis, foot ulcers).

### Evaluation Modalities

- **EKG**: Use if the baseline EKG is normal.
- **Echocardiogram**: Use if the baseline EKG is abnormal or if there is a history of heart failure.
- **Nuclear Imaging**: Use if there is a history of previous coronary artery bypass grafting.

### Interpreting Stress Tests

- **Positive EKG Changes**: Indicate ischemia.
- **Echocardiogram and Nuclear Imaging**: Look for areas of myocardial stunning or reversibility.

## Treatment for Acute Coronary Syndrome

When a patient presents with chest pain, follow the mnemonic **MONA BASH**:

- **M**orphine
- **O**xygen
- **N**itrates
- **A**spirin
- **B**eta-blockers
- **A**ce inhibitors
- **S**tatins
- **H**eparin (therapeutic)

### Discharge Medications

Upon discharge, every patient with vascular disease should receive:

- Beta-blockers
- Aspirin
- Statins

**Considerations**:
- Nitrates for patients with ongoing angina
- Clopidogrel for patients with stents

### Additional Notes

- **Morphine**: Use cautiously, as it may increase mortality.
- **Oxygen**: Administer to improve oxygen carrying capacity, but avoid inducing toxicity.
- **TPA**: Consider in rural settings where PCI is not available, especially if transport time exceeds 60 minutes.

## Conclusion

In summary, remember to identify patients who may have coronary artery disease, learn how to work someone up for chest pain, and understand the treatment options available for those with coronary artery disease.
