# Acute Coronary Syndrome: Overview and Management

This lesson is a follow-up to the previous lesson, which focused on coronary artery disease. We discussed atherosclerotic plaque that grows slowly over time until it reaches critical stenosis, leading to stable angina and stable ischemic heart disease. This plaque continues to grow, with the lipid core expanding more than the fibrocollagenous cap. Eventually, an acute event occurs: the plaque ruptures, exposing the lipid core to pro-thrombotic agents in the blood. This thrombosis rapidly changes the caliber of the lumen, resulting in supply ischemia. 

## Key Concepts of Acute Coronary Syndrome

This lesson will cover rupture and thrombosis, acute coronary syndrome (ACS), and myocardial infarction (MI). 

1. **Understanding Acute Coronary Syndrome**:
   - Rupture and thrombosis transform critical stenosis demand ischemia into supply ischemia.
   - The only way to correct this serious problem is through revascularization to restore blood flow.

2. **Patient Presentation**:
   - Patients will present with the same risk factors as discussed in the last lesson, including atherosclerotic risk factors.
   - Acute chest pain or angina may present as angina at rest.

3. **Diagnostic Approach**:
   - In the acute setting, we utilize acute labs. 
   - A 12-lead EKG is essential to rule out ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
   - Cardiac troponins (either highly specific or standard) can be used to rule in or out non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).
   - CK-MB was previously useful but has been rendered less relevant due to newer, more sensitive tests.

4. **Invasive Testing**:
   - The best test for diagnosing acute coronary syndrome is the invasive coronary angiogram (cath).
   - High-risk patients should go directly to cath after initial evaluation.

## Risk Assessment and Treatment

- **High-Risk Indicators**:
  - ST-segment elevation in two or more anatomically contiguous leads indicates high risk.
  - Elevated troponin levels also signify high risk.
  - If both tests are negative, a complex process is required to rule out myocardial ischemia.

- **Treatment for Acute Coronary Syndrome**:
  - The primary goal is to resupply blood flow through percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
  - Supportive actions can be organized using the acronym MONA BASH:
    - **M**: Morphine
    - **O**: Oxygen
    - **N**: Nitroglycerin
    - **A**: Aspirin
    - **B**: Beta-blockers
    - **S**: Statins
    - **H**: Heparin

## Time Sensitivity in Revascularization

- Historically, revascularization was limited to within 12 hours from symptom onset, but this has been extended to 24 hours. 
- Early intervention (before 12 hours) is ideal, but intervention within 24 hours is still beneficial.
- If a PCI fails, salvage PCI or CABG can be attempted.

## Workflow for Acute Chest Pain

1. **Initial Assessment**:
   - Patients presenting with acute chest pain should be evaluated with a 12-lead ECG to rule out STEMI.
   - If STEMI is confirmed, the patient should be taken to the cath lab emergently.

2. **Management of NSTEMI**:
   - If the 12-lead ECG is negative, troponin levels should be assessed.
   - Positive troponins indicate NSTEMI, requiring urgent cath.
   - If troponins are negative, consider unstable angina, which may also require urgent cath.

3. **Observation and Testing**:
   - Utilize observation units for ruling out acute coronary syndrome.
   - Cardiac CT angiography (CCTA) can assess for stenosis and offers a two-year warranty if negative.

## Complications and Long-Term Management

- Complications can arise from both revascularization and non-revascularization.
- Common complications include:
  - Heart failure
  - Ventricular arrhythmias
  - Pericarditis
  - Rupture of the heart wall or septum

- **Day-by-Day Complications**:
  - **Day 1**: Dying myocytes can trigger ventricular arrhythmias.
  - **Day 3**: Immune cells clear dead myocytes, potentially leading to pericarditis.
  - **Day 5**: Granulation tissue formation can lead to rupture if the heart continues to contract.

## Conclusion

Understanding acute coronary syndrome is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment. The workflow involves ruling out STEMI with a 12-lead ECG and assessing troponins for NSTEMI. Revascularization remains the primary treatment goal, and awareness of potential complications is essential for patient management.
